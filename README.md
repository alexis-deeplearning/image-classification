# Image Classification - CNNs
In this project, we classify images from the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)  dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. We'll be using convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, you'll see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.
